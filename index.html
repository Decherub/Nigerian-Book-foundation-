            NBF's operations are generally under the guidance of the Board of Trustees and the National Advisory Council. The Board of Trustees comprises the President of the Foundation (who is the Chairman of the Board) and not more than ten eminent Nigerians of high repute appointed on merit to reflect the rich diversity if talent nationwide in matters pertaining to book development. 
            The Terms of Reference of the Board of Trustees include: 
            (a) The general superintendence of the policies, finances, and physical assets of the Foundation.

  <h3>MAJOR ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS</h3>
  <div class="text-content" id="textContent6">
      <p>
        1. Nigeria International Book Fair 
        The Annual National Book Week, inaugurated by the NBF in April 1994 and usually held in the second half of April, metamorphosed into the Nigeria International Book Fair (NIBF) in May 2002. The NBF is a founding Trustee of the Nigerian Book Fair Trust (NBFT) which organizes the fair, participating in its activities. 
        2. Book Data Centre
         The NBF Book Data Centre was established in 1995 to serve as a data bank on book related matters. The maiden edition of the DIRECTORY OF NIGERIAN BOOK DEVELOPMENT edited by Chukwuemeka Ike and published in 1998, was the first publication of directories of Nigerian published Authors, Publishing Houses, Book Printers, Book selling and Distribution Organizations, and Libraries. Inadequate funding has hampered the work of the centre. 
        3. Promotion of Reading 
        Funded by Heinrich- Boll Foundation of Germany, the NBF operated pilot reading promotion projects (1996 and 1997) and a 3- year (1998-2000) programme to promote the reading habit among Nigerians. Operating through three Reading Promotion Units in Ibadan (West), Jos (North), and Ndikelionwu (East), the NBF organized 3-day holistic reading promotion activities in urban and rural centres in 18 States of the Federation between 1998 and 2000. 
        The NBF handed over the mobile Library set up at Ibadan as part of the programme to Oyo State Library Board in 2002 at the request of the Board, which transformed it into Bodija Community Library, Bodija, Ibadan. 
        The NBF has the capacity to mount new reading promotion programmes as funds become available.
        4. Book Aid Nigeria (BAN) Project
        As a follow up of the NBF/Heinrich Boll Foundation Reading Promotion Programme which expired in December 2000, the NBF lunched a Book Aid Nigeria (BAN) Project aimed at receiving free donations of a wide range of new books for distribution to public, institutional, community, and other libraries, organizations, and (in approved cases) individuals, to facilitate access to books. The first container of imported books for the project came from International Book Bank Inc, Baltimore, Macmillan, Longman Nigeria and University Press also donated books. A 3- year Project with Sabre Foundation, Massachusetts, U.SA will enable the NBF to receive and distribute two consignments of books from the U.S.A annually. A grant from the Education Tax Fund (ETF) facilitated the acquisition of an NBF warehouse for the project. The NBF welcomes more book donations and funds for the purchase of books, to meet the ever-growing demand for books for formal education and life-long education.
         
        5. Sourcing and Dissemination of indigenous knowledge
        Through organized interviews with identified experts (literate and illiterate) in indigenous knowledge, the NBF has sourced hitherto unpublished information, which it transformed into reading materials for the reading public. Seven Igbo language booklets have been produced. Inadequate funds have held back quality publication of the booklets as well as expansion of the scope of the Project to other Nigerian language groups. 
        6. National Book Distribution Organization 
        The NBF is playing a catalytic role in attempting to establish a National Book Distribution Organization to meet an established need of the Nigerian book sector. 
        7. Publications 
        With funds from Heinrich-Boll Foundation of Germany, the NBF published the following Books in its first decade of existence. MAKING BOOKS READILY AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE (edited by Ezenwa-Ohaeto), 1995 CREATING A CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR BOOK PUBLISHING (edited by chukwuemeka Ike), 1996.
        
        MEETING THE BOOK NEEDS OF THE RURAL FAMILY 
        (edited by Chukwuemeka Ike). 1997 
        DIRECTORY OF NIGERIAN BOOK DEVELOPMENT (edited by Chukwuemeka Ike), 1998.
         THE BOOK IN 21ST CENTURY NIGERIA, AND UNIVERSAL BASIC EDUCATION (edited by Chukwuemeka Ike), 2000 
        CREATING AND SUSTAINING A READING CULTURE (edited by Chukwuemeka Ike) 2000
         Academy Press Plc, Lagos, subsidized the cost of printing the DIRECTORY. Funding is required to update the DIRECTORY and publish new books.
